# @Deferrrrrrrrred
A custom media art software that utilizes a Microsoft Kinect and (a) viewer(s) as an input to create abstract images of reality.

It is a generative piece exploring the relationship between the viewer and art. Not unlike Derrida's concept of Difference, the meaning of art is continually deferred to its viewers and critics. Not unlike Bergson's concept of Multiplicity and Duration, art is relational and temporally construed. The creation of @DEFERRRRRRRRRED is continually deferred by and to the viewer; the viewer and the content interpenetrates each other: temporally and simultaneously. The web of lines in each image and the continual addition of those images give further insight to our relational life as a viewer and an artist, and the compression of experiences within it and art.
